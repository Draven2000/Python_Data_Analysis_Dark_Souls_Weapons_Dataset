# Python_Data_Analysis_Dark_Souls_Weapons_Dataset 
## [30/1/2024 - 9/3/2024]
---

An indivdual project I worked on during the Code Cumbria course to showcase the analytical python skills I developed throughout the course.

The project is in Jupyter Notebook format, with the .ipynb file containing the bulk of my code and markup to explain the code used.

The dataset itself is a list of all the 287 weapons in the video game Dark Souls 3, and the statistics of each weapon.<br>
I chose this dataset as ontop of having a large vareity of data types and columns to practice my analysis on, it is also a game series I personally enjoy.

Dataset sourced from:

As an aside, this CODE-Cumbria project is seperate to the freeCodeCamp Data-Analysis course I have been taking simultaneously online, for which my projects may be found here:
